1. What does it mean to escape data? How does escaping data help us avoid malicious code? 
You escape data to make sure nothing is malicious. Escaping data involves removing and replacing any characters that should 
not appear in a value. Escaping data refers to the process of encoding special characters in data to ensure that it is properly
interpreted by a program or system, especially when the data is being used in contexts like web development or database 
management.Special characters, such as quotation marks, angle brackets, or backslashes, can have special meanings in certain 
contexts. If these characters are not properly escaped, they can be misinterpreted by a program or system, leading to unexpected
behavior or vulnerabilities, including injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).Escaping data helps
us avoid malicious code by ensuring that any special characters within the data are treated as literal characters rather than being 
interpreted as part of a programming or scripting language. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into an application
or system through user input or other data sources.

2. Please read through: https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest
a. What is REST? What is meant by Statelessness?
REpresentation State Transfer (REST), is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making 
it easier for systems to communicate with each other. Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server 
does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. Both the server and the client can understand any 
message received, even without seeing previous messages. This constraint is enforced by the use of resources rather than commands. 

b. What is a resource?
Resources are the nouns of the Web. They describe any object, document, or thing that you may need to store or send to other services. 
A resource is a concept that represents any information or entity that can be accessed or manipulated by the client through the server.
Resources are the primary abstraction in RESTful systems, and they are typically represented by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

c. Look at the section on Path design: In a RESTful architecture paradigm what would be the proper way to create a path for: (provide URL and HTTP method):
i. getting a list of users?
Url: GET fashionboutique.com/users 
HTTP Method: GET
ii. getting a particular user?
Url: GET fashionboutique.com/users/:id 
HTTP Method: GET
iii. saving a user?
Url: POST fashionboutique.com/users
HTTP Method: GET

3. What is a Cookie? 
A cookie is often used to identify a user. It is a small file that the server embeds on the userâ€™s computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values. 

4. What is a Session? 
A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages. Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the user's computer.
